in this code, all of the block's rects are stored in self.chunks which is extremely damaging on memory as pygame rects take up a lot of memory. this means that blocks that aren't even being rendered or considered still sit in memory with their rect whereas it would be better to store these unused blocks in terms of simple attributes which are only the block (e.g. "grass") and the position relative to other blocks (e.g (5, 8)). i implement this in my current code.
